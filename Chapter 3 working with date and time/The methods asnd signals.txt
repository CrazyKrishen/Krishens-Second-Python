The methods provided by QLCDNumber are as follows:
setMode(): This method is used to change the base of the numbers. Available
options are as follows:
Hex: This option is used to display hexadecimal digits
Dec: This option is used to display decimal digits
Oct: This option is used to display octal digits
Bin: This option is used to display binary digits
display(): This method is used to display the supplied data in LCD digit format.
value(): This method returns the numerical value displayed by the LCD Number
widget.



The timeout() signal can be configured or adjusted using the following methods:
start(n): It compels the timer to generate the timeout() signal at n millisecond
intervals
setSingleShot(true): It constrains the timer to generate the timeout() signal
only once
singleShot(n): It makes the timer generate a timeout() signal only once, and
that too after n milliseconds

Before we go ahead and make an application, we need to understand one more class,
QTime, which is used to fetch and measure system clock time. The QTime class not only helps in reading the current time from the system clock but also provides all clock time function. It shows time in terms of hours, minutes, seconds, and
milliseconds since midnight. The timereturned by the QTime class is in 24-hour format.
The methods provided by the QTime class
are as follows:
currentTime(): This method accesses the system clock time and returns it as a
QTime object
hour(): This method returns the number of hours
minute(): This method returns the number of minutes
seconds(): This method returns the number of seconds
msec(): This method returns the number of milliseconds
addSecs(): This method returns the time after adding the specified number of
seconds
addMSecs(): This method returns the time after adding the specified number of
milliseconds
secsTo(): This method returns the difference in the number of seconds between
two QTime objects
msecsTo(): This method returns the difference in the number of milliseconds
between two times



We want the displayed system clock time to be updated automatically. For this, we need to
implement timers.
