For drawing and painting in Python, we will be making use of several classes. The most
important of them is the QPainter class. This class is used for painting. It can draw lines, rectangles, circles, and complex shapes.

Several methods of the QPainter class are used in this chapter to draw different shapes. A
few of them are listed here:
QPainter::drawLine(): This method is used for drawing a line between two
sets of x and y coordinates
QPainter::drawPoints(): This method is used for drawing a point at a
location specified through the supplied x and y coordinates
QPainter::drawRect(): This method is used for drawing a rectangle between
two sets of x and y coordinates
QPainter::drawArc(): This method is used for drawing an arc from the
specified center location, between two specified angles, and with a specified
radius
QPainter::drawText(): This method is used for drawing text in a specified
font style, color, and size
